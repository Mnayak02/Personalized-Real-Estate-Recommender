Condo in a four-unit Edwardian building for sale by owner (FSBO). Unit is vacant and ready for move-in.


SALE PRICE of $650,000 - no agent commissions. WRITE your offer paperwork with a real estate lawyer with a FLAT FEE to keep the sale price down. Buyer and seller pay their own lawyer fees - you can find your own, hire mine, or find an agent who will write your sales offer. No negotiations BUT: YES - you'll need to order house inspections with a qualified professional, and determine if you want to make those minor repairs. 
SOLD AS IS
This six-room flat is sold ""as-is."" It is in great shape and lovely. Needs minor upgrades, but is turnkey ready.


 Please only make offers if you plan to live in the unit.


THE CULTURAL ""PROMISSORY NOTE"": In addition to the sale price, please make an offer of a 10-year ""note"" of something of cultural value. You will be obligated to fulfill that promissory note. Make offers creative! Reach out to your networks to help you buy an affordable flat in the Mission!


It can be something you personally have access to, like 10 years of tickets for the theatre, 10 years VIP tix for music festivals, or 10 years of organic produce from your uncle's farm in Salinas.


It can be something you would have to buy, or something you have access to via your family and friends. Culture and experience are valuable to sellers, and we'd rather barter some of the value of the flat if you have community/cultural capital as a resource. If you offer something you would purchase, like 10 years of tickets to the Great American Music Hall / Slim's, then the expense cap is $3,000 a year.

It is a great flat for people who enjoy diversity, culture, and have a strong desire to live both near the great food and bookstores and activism centers of the Mission, and benefit from proximity to the freeways (101 and 280 and Bay Bridge).


LOCAL COMMUNITY 

Near many latino specialty stores, independent bookstores, unique restaurants and neighborhood cafes within walking and biking distance. THREE of ""The Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants"" are within a few blocks.



WALK AND BIKE EVERYWHERE

The area is a flat area, so bike riding and walking are GREAT and the location is perfectly angled between 20th and 24th Street charms and the fantastically fun Valencia Corridor. 


ART AND MUSIC TRADITIONS
Love the Carnivale music and arts festival, and the Dia de Las Muertas procession, and the many other artistic and lively cultural events within a few blocks of the house. Inviting friends over for Carnivale weekend  is always a big pleasure. ",15151279

Condo in a four-unit Edwardian building for sale by owner (FSBO). Unit is vacant and ready for move-in.


SALE PRICE of $650,000 - no agent commissions. WRITE your offer paperwork with a real estate lawyer with a FLAT FEE to keep the sale price down. Buyer and seller pay their own lawyer fees - you can find your own, hire mine, or find an agent who will write your sales offer. No negotiations BUT: YES - you'll need to order house inspections with a qualified professional, and determine if you want to make those minor repairs. 
SOLD AS IS
This six-room flat is sold ""as-is."" It is in great shape and lovely. Needs minor upgrades, but is turnkey ready.


 Please only make offers if you plan to live in the unit.


THE CULTURAL ""PROMISSORY NOTE"": In addition to the sale price, please make an offer of a 10-year ""note"" of something of cultural value. You will be obligated to fulfill that promissory note. Make offers creative! Reach out to your networks to help you buy an affordable flat in the Mission!


It can be something you personally have access to, like 10 years of tickets for the theatre, 10 years VIP tix for music festivals, or 10 years of organic produce from your uncle's farm in Salinas.


It can be something you would have to buy, or something you have access to via your family and friends. Culture and experience are valuable to sellers, and we'd rather barter some of the value of the flat if you have community/cultural capital as a resource. If you offer something you would purchase, like 10 years of tickets to the Great American Music Hall / Slim's, then the expense cap is $3,000 a year.

LOCAL COMMUNITY 

Near many latino specialty stores, independent bookstores, unique restaurants and neighborhood cafes within walking and biking distance. THREE of ""The Chronicle's Top 100 Restaurants"" are within a few blocks.



WALK AND BIKE EVERYWHERE

The area is a flat area, so bike riding and walking are GREAT and the location is perfectly angled between 20th and 24th Street charms and the fantastically fun Valencia Corridor. 


ART AND MUSIC TRADITIONS
Love the Carnivale music and arts festival, and the Dia de Las Muertas procession, and the many other artistic and lively cultural events within a few blocks of the house. Inviting friends over for Carnivale weekend  is always a big pleasure. ",15151279

Lovely and classic, this 1918 Craftsman home in Upper Lakeshore has a quiet calm and tons of charm. Located where Piedmont and Crocker Highlands intersect, the street has an open feel and gets lots of light. The front yard and architectural details give this house a solid street presence. 

From inside the foyer looking at the living room, you can appreciate the beautiful hardwood floors, the coved ceilings and period built-ins on either side of the marble-tiled fireplace. The Craftsman style grid windows frame a pretty view of greenery.

The dining room, too, has beautiful tree-filled outlooks and has an open floor plan that leads gracefully into the kitchen, with a butcher-block counter/bar bridging the two rooms. A stainless steel sink and appliances and maize quartz countertops bring lots of style and function. At the back of the kitchen is a laundry nook and lots of storage. The dramatic French doors with a palladium arch lead to a level-out backyard of lush terraced gardens, paved outdoor dining spaces, a built-in grill, a fire pit and abundant space for playing and entertaining for all ages. A long driveway provides plenty of off-street parking.

Two bedrooms and a full bathroom complete the downstairs. Upstairs is another bedroom with an angled ceiling and giant swing-in casement windows. The master bedroom is spacious and bright; soaring ceilings and high windows capture views of the sky, all the windows frame exceptionally pretty garden views. Through sliding glass doors a deck and outside staircase gives access to the the yard. The bath is like a spa: skylights, mosaic tiles, a large soaking tub and a fancy glassed-in shower with two swing-arm shower heads offer plenty of luxury. A bonus small office/sitting room is an ideal reading nook, art studio or play space.  

The vibrant Lakeshore shopping district beckons close by with Peet's Coffee, Starbucks, Trader Joe's, the Farmer's Market, the Grand Lake Theater and some of Oakland's best restaurants all within easy walking distance. This historic area is also minutes from Lake Merritt and affords easy accessibility to San Francisco by car or public transportation.

From the street, it is a handsome Prairie Style, traditional and stately, with English Yews on either side of a large, multi-lite beveled glass door. Once inside, from the level-in entrance, one can appreciate the architectural details of stepped ceilings, crown moldings, hardwood floors and period built-ins in both the living room and the dining room. The large living room has a gorgeous tiled Craftsman fireplace as a focal point; both rooms have lovely tree-filled outlooks from the front.

Moving through the swing door in the dining room, the kitchen and breakfast nook are sunny and bright, with fantastic hill views from all the windows. Granite counters, pantry built-ins, a wine refrigerator and a convenient powder room make this room a great place to create meals and memories.

Upstairs are three bedrooms and a bonus sunroom/office space with more fabulous views of both the hills, including Mount Tamalpais, and the scenic back yard. A spacious bathroom has wonderful 1920s details: original porcelain fixtures and huge stand alone shower with beautiful vintage tile. The master bedroom has a lovely archway leading to a sitting area and the en suite bathroom, which also has a period feel. At twilight, spectacular sunsets fill the windows from many vantage points.

On the lower floor, another surprise - a bonus independent au pair/in-law apartment downstairs with separate entrance is a whole other world - a bedroom, living room, kitchen, dining area and bathroom, beautifully designed and with lots of storage. This level opens out onto the yard, making indoor/outdoor entertaining even easier.

The backyard is a marvel, it begins with a tiered brick patio overlooking a huge, level grassy play yard. This yard is exceptional in so many ways besides its size; it has lovely landscaping, including citrus and peach trees, a dawn redwood, giant impatiens, jasmine and sage; a garden shed in the corner and at the bottom of the bricked steps is a gate accessing Walavista Avenue. This yard is ideal for barbecues and other get-togethers to enjoy the temperate climate of Crocker Highlands.

This wonderfully-situated home is just a few blocks to the shops in the vibrant Lakeshore District, home to the well-loved and acclaimed Farmer's Market, many of Oakland's best restaurants, (both fine and casual), and family-friendly parks, all within easy walking distance. This historic area is also minutes from Lake Merritt and affords easy accessibility to San Francisco by car or public transportation.  

This is a home to discover and enjoy in so many ways, not the least of which its comfort, charm and style.

This is how they used to make houses: large rooms, beautiful architectural details, comfort and style existing effortlessly together. The bold silhouette of this 1919 Prairie-style Craftsman is softened by lush landscaping of jasmine, rosemary, abutilon, salvia and vines of Thompson grapes. A large porch welcomes in a classic manner.

The living room is large and light-filled, with a stone fireplace bracketed by bookshelves. Giant picture windows frame views of the hills. Wainscoting, crown molding and handsome oak floors bring yet more elegance. 

The formal dining room is big and bright, with windows overlooking the garden. The convivial, airy open floor plan brings the kitchen and dining room together, separated by a low kitchen bar. The kitchen is the heart of the home, and this one is all charm. Sleek veined quartz counters, a subway tile back splash, stainless steel appliances, maple floors and a cheerful view from oversized steel casement windows make this an especially appealing place to cook, entertain friends or hang out with the family. A powder room and guest room off the kitchen overlooks the garden.

Outside, the tiered garden is thoughtfully designed with lime, lemon, grapefruit and blood orange trees; fountain grass, herbs, roses and other drought-tolerant plants fill the raised beds. A deck and studio shed, the ""Little House,""  is a lovely locale to both entertain and to get away. 

Upstairs are three sizeable bedrooms, two of which overlook the garden, one has a calm sun room with tree-filled outlooks, all have nice walk-in closets. A hall bathroom has a vintage penny-tile floor and pedestal sink, and a built-in linen cabinet in the hallway is a nice period detail. The master bedroom has banks of windows capturing the light and views.

A fabulous location in the vibrant Lakeshore/Grand Lake neighborhood is another highlight of this home, with every need within walking distance: the Farmer's Market, grocery and hardware stores, in addition to the Lakeshore shopping district and some of Oakland's best restaurants. This historic area is also minutes from Lake Merritt and affords easy accessibility to San Francisco by car or public transportation.  

Spacious and gracious, this is a classic beauty, a great place to call home.

Downtown Santa Clara County Assessor's Parcel Number (APN): 120-30-045. 

Imagine if you will how much the units could rent for if one were to upgrade a little, furnish them and lease them to businesses that have employees traveling here or need temporary relocation. Probably 3,500 - 4,000 per unit/month cash flow. That's about 16,000 per month.  Now go do your mortgage math and you can see why downtown Palo Alto is such a value to own. More can be done with this lot. This is one of the bigger lots on Alma where there are both business and homes on the same block in the SOFA (South Of Forest Area). Close to public transportation and walking distance to Palo Alto high school downtown university ave., town and country shopping center, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Stanford.

This is a single story 4 plex apartment building on a large lot. Bigger could be built today. It has multiple street address, perhaps originally planned to be converted to condos.  These four 1 BD 1BA units have rents under market. In downtown Palo Alto edge of SOFA, far enough away from train station that you don't hear the train breaks stopping. Separate laundry room. Separate storage.  Additional 120sq ft artist studio behind one of the units. All rents currently well under market with long time tenants now on month-to-month rents.  Look at the lot map photo, two lots behind it 35 & 36 or on the side 47 & 46. This is bigger than those put together and those homes will easily sell for 3-3.5M each today. 

You would be surprised how much money this downtown Palo Alto corner produces in cash flow today. I select tenants with monthly incomes and high credit scores such that paying the rent is no big deal. In exchange, I have little to do and keep the rents low.
