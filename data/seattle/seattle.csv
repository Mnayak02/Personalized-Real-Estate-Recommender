This bright sunny updated home welcomes you with warm hickory hardwoods floors and modern LED lighting throughout.  It has many added green features including improved insulation and convenient tech upgrades like WiFi enabled thermostats and lights, touchscreen keypad door locks, and USB chargers built into the wall outlets.

Come on in.  Open the solid wood front door to an entryway with skylight and coat closet.   Move into the adjoining bright sunny living room, where you find a natural stone hearth, a thermostatically controlled gas fireplace, and a wall-mounted TV.  The adjacent dining room connects with a remodeled kitchen.  We redesigned things to make extra space and in the process added new granite counters and sink, a tile back-splash, additional cabinets, new overhead and under-cabinet lighting, and new appliances including a particularly super exhaust fan.   

From the kitchen, pass through multi-light French doors out onto the 170-sq foot deck where you can enjoy one of the few territorial views in Rose Hill.  Just watch your garden grow or eat your meal as the sun sets over the Olympic Mountains.  

All three bedrooms have hickory floors, ample closet space and daylight. The two tile floor baths have plenty of light and updated hardware.  The new shower head is the best I've ever found.  There is an attached two-car garage, a laundry room with granite, extensive storage, and new HardiePlank shingle siding and trim outside (warrantee through 2045, included).  

Also outdoors, you are situated on a 9,880 square foot Rose Hill lot, with new landscaping, a mature ever-bearing raspberry patch, a large terraced vegetable garden, fruit trees and a big open back yard.  Yes, the garden and backyard get full sunshine.

The entry of the condo is characterized by a set of double doors, perfect for transporting larger pieces of furniture in and out. Polished hardwood floors line the entryway and extend to the corridor, kitchen, and dining room. An assortment of quaint features such as a lazy Susan in one of the kitchen cupboards, track lighting in the bedroom and living room, and full length mirrors on all the bedroom closet doors add a level of uniqueness and distinguishment to the home. The living room, master bedroom, and one of the auxiliary rooms are all connected to private balconies. Each room enjoys spaciousness and ceiling to floor windows which further integrate the condo into the natural beauty directly outside. Speaking of natural beauty, the dozens of trees which surround the unit not only contribute to the seclusion and privacy of the condo, but also keep the interior cool even on Seattle's hottest days. With a walk-in closet in the master, another in the living room, as well as a storage unit in the building lobby provided by Sixty 01 alongside two covered parking spaces, storage is not likely to be an issue.
